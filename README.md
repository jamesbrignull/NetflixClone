# Netflix Clone
## Overview
Completed this as the capstone project to the Scrimba Front-end Developer Career Path, with this part of the path being taught by Karl Hadwen. This was an excellent opportunity to put together a lot of the skills and concepts developed whilst going through the career path into one project that mimics a real-life business service. 

## Tech & Tools Used
* React
* React Router
* Firebase
* Styled Components
* JSX
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Fuse.js

## Key Takeaways
* Architecture - I found it incredibly useful to understand how a larger project was designed and put together and how strong architecture underpins everything moving forward. It was also interesting to hear the pros and cons of utilising certain tools, such as styled components. 
* Authentication - This was my first project using firebase. It was great to be able to add this feature without writing any server-side code and was a great chance to interact with an API in a real-life business scenario. 
* Big React App - I loved spending this much time with React. It's so fun! The size of the project really allowed me to get phenomenal reps in with the framework and also got me used to reading and editing large code bases.
